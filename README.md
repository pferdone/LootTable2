LootTable2
==========

LootTable2 is a very simple addon and works right out of the box. Just copy the LootTable2 & Tradeskills2 folder to your addon directory and you can record item drops immediately. LootTable2 does the following for you:

* display list of items a mob has dropped after being killed
* display drop chance of items/amount of money according to your kill history
* display small item icons next to item names and their appropiate item quality color
* display number of kill recorded for that specific mob
* Any suggestions for additional features are welcome! Enjoy!
